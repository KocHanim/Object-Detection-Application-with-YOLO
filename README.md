# Object-Detection-Application-with-YOLO
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect objects from image or video streams.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Project Description: 
The project is developed using Python programming language and OpenCV library. 
Image capture is performed with the camera and these images are analysed by the YOLO model. 
The detected objects are drawn on the frame and displayed on the screen. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Key Features: 
The project has the following key features:

Real Time Object Detection: Our project can perform real-time object detection on the camera image. Objects are instantly identified and marked on the screen.

YOLO Model Integration: Our project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. YOLO allows multiple objects to be detected in a single pass and is high speed.

Easy to Use: Starting and using the project is quite simple. All you need to do is install the necessary dependencies and start the project.

Customisable Colours: Instead of different colours for each object, fixed colours are used for the same object each time. This makes it easier to identify objects.

Open Source and MIT Licence: The project is open source and licensed with the MIT Licence. This allows the project to be freely used and contributed to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Usage: 
You can use the model for object detection or experiment with the model for further refinement :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Requirements: 
Python (3.x)
OpenCV (cv2)
YOLO model and YOLOv4 weight files
